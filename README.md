# COMP_SCI_303_HW3

This program requires running both the queue class and the insertSort List class to build their respective structures. Then each data structure has integers inserted into them. The queue needs to display the code before, then after we run the move_to_rear function to move the first element to the back of the queue and push up all the other elements. For the sorted list, you have to put in some random ints, then use the insertSort function after to sort the list. Unfortunately, I couldn't get my code to run so I have no outputs.
